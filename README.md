# Django Training

All web apps need persist and retrieve data to be useful. You can use Django-[ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) to access and update your persisted data. The business of retrieving and storing data can be done in multiple ways, some better than others.

Reading through https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/optimization/ is a good first step. This is training module contains exercises to help solidify the learnings.

## Getting started
- Clone this repo
- Run `. script/bootstrap` to initialize dependencies and virtualenv (see more https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)
- Go to one of the exercises, eg `cd exercise/exercise_1`
- Run the test to see what was expected, eg `inv test --exercise=1` or `inv test 1`
- Fix the implementation, eg `goto exercise/exercise_1/use_cases.py`
- For a reference to documentation that will help you solve the question use `inv test 1 --hint`
- Run the test to verify your solution, eg `inv test 1`
